# Zero-OS Storage Cluster

A Zero-OS cluster typically hosts (as a workload) one or more storage clusters.

Setting up a storage cluster is achieved through the REST API exposed by the Zero-OS Orchestrator, as documented in [Setup a Storage Cluster](./setup.md)

Once you have a storage cluster setup it can be used for multiple purposes, most importantly for creating vdisks as discussed in [Block Storage](../blockstorage/blockstorage.md).
